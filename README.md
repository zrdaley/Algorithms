###Assignment Description
Input: An array 𝐴 of 𝑛 non-negative integers.

Output: A boolean value (true or false). If there are three indices 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘 such that 0 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘 ≤
𝑛 − 1 and 𝐴[𝑖] + 𝐴[𝑗] + 𝐴[𝑘] = 225, the output will be true. If no such indices exist, the output will be false. Note that 𝑖, 𝑗 and 𝑘 do not have to be distinct.
